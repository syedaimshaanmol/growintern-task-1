# growintern task-1
As part of the GrowInternship program, I successfully completed Task No. 1, which focused on designing a set of social media graphics for our company's various platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This task served as an introduction to the internship, allowing me to practice designing for different formats and audiences while maintaining adherence to our company's visual identity.
